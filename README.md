# graphql-for-vscode-mono-repo
autocompletion test for mono repo with graphql-for-vscode plugin

### Install

- `yarn`

### test

Note that autocompletion will not work in `packages/test/src/Component/query.gql`.

It will however work if you rename the `_.gqlconfig` to `.gqlconfig` as this file is expected to be in the workspace root.
